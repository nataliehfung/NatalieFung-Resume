        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Natalie Fung and I was most recently employed as a Business Administrations manager. Our company worked with clients in order to ensure their desires are met. I actively supervised this operation, as a means to efficiently provide a productive workspace and environment for everyone. When it came to managing this business, I performed a wide variety of tasks to reach our goals and achievements. Ranging from brainstorming different business strategies to examining the company's general achievements and performance, I tended to this company with a deep passion. Our clients have always been pleased with the way we ran our operations, indicating that we were on track with our business performance. Managing this company was a huge accomplishment for me. As much as it was hard work, it was an extremely satisfying experience and sight to see it running smoothly with my fellow employees working together.</p><br><br>

        I also worked as an employee before I became a manager, therefore I was able to experience the routine of a typical employee in the business administration field. This way, it gives me the opportunity to resonate with fellow employees and receive a sense of their career ambitions. As an employee who primarily dealt with Human Resources, I often encounter many types of people in many different situations. Doing this, I have developed a strong sense of people and how differently one approaches the situation from another. Being able to efficiently communicate with clients and fellow employees, I believe, plays a huge role in the way I helped my company. Fortunately, this gave me the skills to thoroughly recruit and categorize staff members, determine which new employees would come in, manage systems for salaries and payroll, and much more. The responsibilities led me to a great success in the business field, which is why I believe I have suitable experience. However, I am very much aware that I can still greatly improve in those assets and I am eagerly willing to do so. Learning in new environments will provide me with a vast range of possibilities, opportunities, and skills in order for me to proudly contribute to my work.<br><br>

        I strive to educate myself even more than before and from this, I sincerely wish to thrive in whatever workplace in which I am lucky to be working. My recent work experiences have derived many accomplishments of which I am proud to have contributed even in the slightest bit. I believe that a productive workspace is one where you can actively and openly share your achievements, prioritize the work that needs to be done, while also maintaining a stable relationship with the people surrounding you for a healthy work environment. Working in the business field has opened my eyes to the greater achievements I have yet to unlock and I am greatly looking forward to reaching that very moment. Business has been and will continue to be my passion and dedication, as I live for the idea of helping others with their business relations and endeavors.
